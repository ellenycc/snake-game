# JavaScript Project – Snake Game

I created this Retro Snake Game by following the Beginner JavaScript Project – Snake Game Tutorial of [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY). The project was built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Learning points include how to draw the game board, create the snake and randomly generated food, make the snake move, increase the snake size when it eats, increase its speed, keep the score, track collisions for the snake, and display your high score.
